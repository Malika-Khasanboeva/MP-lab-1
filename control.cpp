/*

2.
A while loop checks the condition before running, so it may not execute at all.
A do-while loop checks the condition after running, so it always executes at least once.


3. 
A switch chooses one block of code to run based on a variableâ€™s value.
- case matches specific values.
- break ends execution of that case.
- default runs if no cases match.

4.
With &&, if the first condition is false, the second is not checked.
With ||, if the first condition is true, the second is not checked.
